        <u><i>Call for Participants JASEIN (Junior Academics in Strategy, Entrepreneurship and Innovation in the Netherlands)</i></u>

        <br><br>

        Dutch universities are increasingly attracting a diverse range of management researchers. However, a collective forum is absent in which early-career scholars get to know each other, share ideas, and invest in mutual interests. Both universities and young researchers need to take advantage of this untapped potential and the resulting future impact they can create together.

        <br><br>

        JASEIN aims to gather Assistant Professors in the fields of Strategy, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation across Dutch universities. At its core, JASEIN has a summit in which participants get to know each other in an informal, cozy setting, present their research areas in a forward-looking manner, and engage in discussions about how to leverage academic and business opportunities in the Netherlands. In short, the summit aims to strengthen the relationship between early career Management scholars across the Netherlands.

        <br><br>

        The first edition of the JASEIN summit will be held at the beautiful <a href="https://www.kasteelkerckebosch.com/" >castle Kerckebosch</a>. We look forward to welcoming you on <u>January 25th at 16:00</u> for drinks and a dinner reception followed by a full day of social and professional development on <u>January 26th</u>. Event expenses are paid by this year&apos;s host, University of Amsterdam Business School, so participants need only to cover transportation and accommodation. We have rooms reserved at a reduced rate at Kasteel Kerckebosch, please indicate in your application if you&apos;d like us to reserve a room.

        <br><br>

        Apply <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdjMyCS5Os2ZLB8Nd9HSJ5gCf_6dAcH_E6nwYF53v_5vCtK_g/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>. The event has approximately 40 spots. There is no specific criteria, but we make sure synergy in research interests and a fair balance across their affiliated universities.

        <br><br>
