    <h2>The 2024 summit</h2>

    <p>
        The inaugural edition of JASEIN (Junior Academics in Strategy, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation in the
        Netherlands) was held on Jan. 25th & 26th at the beautiful castle Kerckebosch, sponsored by the University of
        Amsterdam Business School (UvA-ABS). 47 assistant professors from 10 Dutch universities gathered together for
        the first time to get to know each other and discuss their academic ambitions, challenges as well as their future
        research ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary goal of this initiative was to cultivate a vibrant academic network to foster information exchange,
        stimulate research collaboration, and offer social support to Assistant Professors working in the Netherlands.
        To achieve this objective, JASEIN did not follow the classic format of academic conferences and seminars and was
        not held in an academic environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        The event includes both social and academic activities. The participants were welcomed on Thursday afternoon
         for a welcome cocktail and sit-down dinner. The participants of each university were distributed across
         different tables to give them the maximum chance to meet different people. A pop quiz over the Netherlands and
         academic questions played as an ice breaker.

    <p>
        Friday was the main day of the event. The event officially starts with welcoming remarks by the co-organizers.

    <p>
       Then a panel was run to discuss grants, impact and valorization in Dutch universities. Three experienced colleagues,
        Panikos Georgolis (UvA), Vittoria Scalera (UvA), and Janina Klein (VU), moderated by Joris Berns (TSB) discussed
        each topic, their relations, and successful strategies to realise these opportunities. One big take-away from
        this discussion was anticipating the increased dependence on “Other income streams“ as the third pillar of funding
        research in Dutch universities. A lively conversation was had about constructing greater ties with industry partners,
        contract teaching/research for organizations/government. In nutshell, thinking about valorization as an independent
        branch of research activity that can be progressed in parallel to pursuing academic publications.

    <p>
        Next, Arien van Witteloostuijn (VU) took the floor to introduce an in-progress database, FIRMBACKBONE, a longitudinal
        data-infrastructure with information on Dutch companies for scientific research and education. The database is based
        on annual reports of Dutch companies and includes hundreds of variables, covering financial data and main strategic
        actions. To put it in perspective, this database intends to be more accessible and better suited for the study of
        Dutch firms than is currently offered by Statistics Netherlands (CBS).

    <p>
        After lunch and a walk in the surrounding area, a rotating roundtable, inspired by the cafe method, was run. During
        this session, participants were divided into smaller groups of 8 or 9 based on their research interest keywords to
        get the chance to introduce themselves and share their future research ideas. Each table was run by a chair who
        moderated this 45-minute discussion by classifying and connecting the research ideas. Then the tables were switched
        in spans of 10 minutes, so participants could know the discussed ideas in other tables and relate/add their own.
        After the full round, they returned to their original table to discuss what had been added to their initial ideas
        by other participants.

    <p>
        The last activity was a roundtable based on a 'Limitations and Constraints' exercise that participants submitted
        in advance of the event. During this session, we discussed co-authorship, research pipeline, teaching, funding,
        and other challenges. In each of these roundtables we also addressed how JASEIN can contribute to the resolution
        of these issues and other potential solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The event closed with some announcements of upcoming events ('Community Board') that participants presented to
        the group (VU Ecosystem Day, NIAS symposium on the Built Environment and the Spatial Segregation of Neighborhood
        Orgs/Entrepreneurs, Workshop on Organizational Legitimacy (VU), DARE Annual Meeting).  We ended the closing
        session with an acknowledgement of our sponsors, ABS and the section heads of S&IB and E&I.
