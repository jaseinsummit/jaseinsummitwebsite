    <h2>Introducing JASEIN</h2>

    <p>
        <b>JASEIN</b> (<b>J</b>unior <b>A</b>cademics in <b>S</b>trategy <b>E</b>ntrepreneurship and <b>I</b>nnovation
        in the <b>N</b>etherlands) is a network for Assistant Professors based in the Netherlands working in the field
        of strategy, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Our primary goal is to cultivate a vibrant academic network and
        foster valuable connections among early-career researchers. Beyond the exchange of ideas, the network also
        embraces a social dimension, providing opportunities for informal interactions and shared experiences that
        enrich both our academic pursuits and personal sense of belonging in Dutch academia.
    </p>

    <h2>A Bird&apos;s-Eye View of JASEIN 2025 </h2>
      <p>
          The 2nd annual summit of JASEIN (Junior Academics in Strategy, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation in the
          Netherlands) was held on January 23rd and 24th 2025 at Hotel de Leijhof in Oisterwijk. This year&apos;s summit was
          generously sponsored by the Organization Studies and Strategy & Entrepreneurship departments of Tilburg
          University. The summit was organized by representatives from UvA, VU, RSM and Groningen, TiU.
      </p>

      <p>
          The primary objective of JASEIN is to cultivate a vibrant academic network to foster information exchange,
          stimulate research collaboration, and offer social support to Assistant Professors working in the Netherlands.
          Thus, staying true to this objective, the summit did not follow the strictly formal format of academic
          conferences, and was held in an open and supportive environment. The event kicked off with an evening of
          socializing, the highlight of which was the Tilburg-themed &quot;pub-quiz&quot; that took place over dinner. This was
          followed the next day with several social and academic activities, which provided the participants useful
          information for thriving in Dutch academia as well as ample opportunities to interact with their peers.
      </p>
      <p>
          Highlights included:
        <ul>
            <li>- A panel discussion with Jermain Kaminski (Maastricht), Joris Knoben (Tilburg), and Laura Dupin (UvA) about
              the use and opportunities of employing Dutch data;</li>
            <li>- A &quot;rapid connections&quot; networking activity to facilitate finding like-minded peers for research
              collaboration;</li>
            <li>- Another panel discussion with four Department Heads discussing the challenges of Dutch higher education
              and how Assistant Professors can navigate these uncertain times;</li>
            <li>- A round-table discussion session on relevant themes of being an academic in the Netherlands, such as women
              in Dutch academia and life as an immigrant academic, followed by a fun group exercise!</li>

    </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          Thanks to the efforts of the JASEIN organizing committee and the support of the Strategy and Entrepreneurship
          department and the Organization Studies department of Tilburg University, the 2nd JASEIN summit was a rousing
          success. Participants, in their feedback, particularly highlighted the &quot;strong feeling of community&quot; that has
          resulted from the summit and how it enabled them to &quot;connect with like-minded peers at a similar stage&quot; as
          them.
