    <h2> JASEIN 2025 </h2>
      <p>
          The 2nd annual summit of JASEIN (Junior Academics in Strategy, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation in the
          Netherlands) was held on January 23rd and 24th 2025 at Hotel de Leijhof in Oisterwijk. This year&apos;s summit was
          generously sponsored by the Organization Studies and Strategy & Entrepreneurship departments of Tilburg
          University. The summit was organized by representatives from UvA, VU, RSM and Groningen, TiU.
      </p>

      <p>
          The primary objective of JASEIN is to cultivate a vibrant academic network to foster information exchange,
          stimulate research collaboration, and offer social support to Assistant Professors working in the Netherlands.
          Thus, staying true to this objective, the summit did not follow the strictly formal format of academic
          conferences, and was held in an open and supportive environment. The event kicked off with an evening of
          socializing, the highlight of which was the Tilburg-themed &quot;pub-quiz&quot; that took place over dinner. This was
          followed the next day with several social and academic activities, which provided the participants useful
          information for thriving in Dutch academia as well as ample opportunities to interact with their peers.
      </p>
      <p>
          Highlights included:
        <ul>
            <li>- A panel discussion with Jermain Kaminski (Maastricht), Joris Knoben (Tilburg), and Laura Dupin (UvA) about
              the use and opportunities of employing Dutch data;</li>
            <li>- A &quot;rapid connections&quot; networking activity to facilitate finding like-minded peers for research
              collaboration;</li>
            <li>- Another panel discussion with four Department Heads discussing the challenges of Dutch higher education
              and how Assistant Professors can navigate these uncertain times;</li>
            <li>- A round-table discussion session on relevant themes of being an academic in the Netherlands, such as women
              in Dutch academia and life as an immigrant academic, followed by a fun group exercise!</li>

    </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          Thanks to the efforts of the JASEIN organizing committee and the support of the Strategy and Entrepreneurship
          department and the Organization Studies department of Tilburg University, the 2nd JASEIN summit was a rousing
          success. Participants, in their feedback, particularly highlighted the &quot;strong feeling of community&quot; that has
          resulted from the summit and how it enabled them to &quot;connect with like-minded peers at a similar stage&quot; as
          them.

    <h2>JASEIN 2024 </h2>

    <p>
        The inaugural edition of JASEIN (Junior Academics in Strategy, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation in the
        Netherlands) was held on Jan. 25th & 26th at the beautiful castle Kerckebosch, sponsored by the University of
        Amsterdam Business School (UvA-ABS). 47 assistant professors from 10 Dutch universities gathered together for
        the first time to get to know each other and discuss their academic ambitions, challenges as well as their future
        research ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary goal of this initiative was to cultivate a vibrant academic network to foster information exchange,
        stimulate research collaboration, and offer social support to Assistant Professors working in the Netherlands.
        To achieve this objective, JASEIN did not follow the classic format of academic conferences and seminars and was
        not held in an academic environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        The event includes both social and academic activities. The participants were welcomed on Thursday afternoon
         for a welcome cocktail and sit-down dinner. The participants of each university were distributed across
         different tables to give them the maximum chance to meet different people. A pop quiz over the Netherlands and
         academic questions played as an ice breaker.
    </p>

    <p>
        Friday was the main day of the event. The event officially starts with welcoming remarks by the co-organizers.

    <p>
       Then a panel was run to discuss grants, impact and valorization in Dutch universities. Three experienced colleagues,
        Panikos Georgolis (UvA), Vittoria Scalera (UvA), and Janina Klein (VU), moderated by Joris Berns (TSB) discussed
        each topic, their relations, and successful strategies to realise these opportunities. One big take-away from
        this discussion was anticipating the increased dependence on “Other income streams“ as the third pillar of funding
        research in Dutch universities. A lively conversation was had about constructing greater ties with industry partners,
        contract teaching/research for organizations/government. In nutshell, thinking about valorization as an independent
        branch of research activity that can be progressed in parallel to pursuing academic publications.

    <p>
        Next, Arien van Witteloostuijn (VU) took the floor to introduce an in-progress database, FIRMBACKBONE, a longitudinal
        data-infrastructure with information on Dutch companies for scientific research and education. The database is based
        on annual reports of Dutch companies and includes hundreds of variables, covering financial data and main strategic
        actions. To put it in perspective, this database intends to be more accessible and better suited for the study of
        Dutch firms than is currently offered by Statistics Netherlands (CBS).

    <p>
        After lunch and a walk in the surrounding area, a rotating roundtable, inspired by the cafe method, was run. During
        this session, participants were divided into smaller groups of 8 or 9 based on their research interest keywords to
        get the chance to introduce themselves and share their future research ideas. Each table was run by a chair who
        moderated this 45-minute discussion by classifying and connecting the research ideas. Then the tables were switched
        in spans of 10 minutes, so participants could know the discussed ideas in other tables and relate/add their own.
        After the full round, they returned to their original table to discuss what had been added to their initial ideas
        by other participants.

    <p>
        The last activity was a roundtable based on a 'Limitations and Constraints' exercise that participants submitted
        in advance of the event. During this session, we discussed co-authorship, research pipeline, teaching, funding,
        and other challenges. In each of these roundtables we also addressed how JASEIN can contribute to the resolution
        of these issues and other potential solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The event closed with some announcements of upcoming events ('Community Board') that participants presented to
        the group (VU Ecosystem Day, NIAS symposium on the Built Environment and the Spatial Segregation of Neighborhood
        Orgs/Entrepreneurs, Workshop on Organizational Legitimacy (VU), DARE Annual Meeting).  We ended the closing
        session with an acknowledgement of our sponsors, ABS and the section heads of S&IB and E&I.
